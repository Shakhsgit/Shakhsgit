## Excel Projects:     
> ### [Analysis of Inflation and GDP Growth](https://github.com/shakhscode/Inflation-and-GDP-Growth-Analysis-G20Countries#inflation-and-gdp-growth-analysis-g20-countries)

**Aim of the project:**
Analysing inflation and GDP growth rate in G20 countries and preparing a visual report that shows the following insights
- How inflation and GDP growth rate changed in G20 countries from 1998 to 2022.
- In a particular year which country faced highest inflation, lowest inflation and had highest GDP growth rate, lowest GDP growth rate ?
- For a particular G20 country which was the best year and the worst year for Inflation and GDP growth rate.
- Is inflation in 2022 higher than all time average ? Is it higher than forecasted rate ?

**Used tools:**
- Excel Power Query - For data extraction and data cleaning
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts - To design an interactive dashboard.

**Experience gained:**
Data Extraction,Data Cleaning, Data Transformation and Integration, Dashboarding


## Python Projects:
> ### [Python Web Application](https://github.com/shakhscode/WebApplicationPrototype-using-Bokeh-Panel#python-web-app-prototype)

Designed a prototype of a web application using Bokeh and Panel library. The project prototype basically shows how we can easily build a fully operational website using python libraries like Bokeh and Panel without using web framework like Flask and Django.

Used tools: python, matplotlib, bokeh, panel

> ### [Visual Analysis to Detect Fraudulent Transactions](https://github.com/shakhscode/VisualAnalyticsUsingGraphNetworks#detection-of-fraudulent-transactions-by-graphical-analysis)

**Aim:**
A visual analytics task to detect fraud transactions using visualization techniques only. The task is solved using graph network visualization.

**Used tools:**
python, numpy, pandas, pyvis, networkx

**Experience gained:**
Data cleaning, Data visualization.
